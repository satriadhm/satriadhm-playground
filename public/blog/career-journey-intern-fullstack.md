# My Journey from Intern to Full-Stack Engineer

Looking back at my journey in software engineering, I realize how much I've grown since my first internship. Each role taught me valuable lessons that shaped not just my technical skills, but also my approach to problem-solving and teamwork.

## The Beginning: First Internship at Sagara Technology

My journey started in December 2022 when I joined **Sagara Technology** as a Software Engineer Intern. I was nervous, excited, and honestly, a bit overwhelmed.

### What I Learned:
- **Python Django** fundamentals
- **Database design** and migrations
- **Team collaboration** in a professional environment
- **Code reviews** and their importance

The **AteEat** project I worked on taught me that software engineering isn't just about writing code—it's about solving real problems for real people.

## Expanding Horizons: KamarPelajar.id (Remote)

Working remotely with a **Stockholm-based startup** was a game-changer. For six months, I collaborated across time zones and cultures.

### Key Achievements:
- Built a **monolithic architecture** serving 5,000+ users
- Developed **responsive web applications**
- Learned **remote collaboration** best practices
- Gained experience with **international business practices**

**Lesson learned**: Communication is everything in remote work. Over-communication is better than under-communication.

## International Experience: FPT Software, Vietnam

Being selected for FPT's Global Internship Program (2% acceptance rate from 8,000+ applicants) was a pivotal moment.

### Living in Hanoi taught me:
- **Cross-cultural collaboration**
- **Enterprise-level development** practices
- **System scalability** (supporting 25,000+ users)
- **International work standards**

```javascript
// The PEAR API architecture I implemented
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Controller-Service-Repository pattern
app.get('/api/users', userController.getUsers);
app.post('/api/users', userController.createUser);
```

## Quality Focus: Dinotis Official

My internship at **Dinotis** shifted my perspective on software quality. As a QA intern, I learned:

- **Manual testing** methodologies
- **Bug reporting** and documentation
- **Quality assurance** processes
- **Attention to detail**

**Impact**: 30% reduction in critical bugs, 100% feature coverage

This role taught me that great software isn't just about features—it's about reliability and user experience.

## Banking Sector: Bank Rakyat Indonesia

Working with **Indonesia's largest bank** brought new challenges:

### Technical Achievements:
- **5 microservices** with 100% quality compliance
- **GraphQL and NestJS** implementation
- **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines**
- **Third-party API integrations**

### What I Learned About Enterprise Development:
- **Security is paramount** in financial systems
- **Code quality standards** must be non-negotiable
- **Documentation** is as important as code
- **Scalability** must be planned from day one

## Current Role: R&D at Formulatrix

Now as an **R&D Software Engineer**, I'm working on laboratory automation systems that impact scientific research globally.

### Current Focus:
- **Migration projects** from legacy systems
- **Scientific software development**
- **Hardware-software integration**
- **Global impact** through scientific tools

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Technology is Just a Tool
Every company taught me different technologies, but the real skill is **problem-solving**. Whether it's Go, Java, Python, or TypeScript, the principles remain the same.

### 2. Communication Matters More Than Code
The best engineers I've worked with weren't necessarily the most technically brilliant—they were the ones who could:
- **Explain complex concepts** simply
- **Collaborate effectively** with diverse teams
- **Document their work** clearly
- **Mentor others** generously

### 3. Quality Over Speed
Early in my career, I focused on shipping features quickly. Experience taught me that:
- **Technical debt** compounds over time
- **Testing** saves more time than it costs
- **Code reviews** prevent more bugs than they catch
- **Refactoring** is maintenance, not waste

### 4. Global Perspective is Invaluable
Working with teams in **Vietnam**, **Sweden**, and **Spain** broadened my understanding of:
- **Cultural differences** in work styles
- **International business practices**
- **Global software standards**
- **Cross-timezone collaboration**

## Advice for Aspiring Engineers

### For Beginners:
1. **Focus on fundamentals** over frameworks
2. **Build projects** that solve real problems
3. **Read other people's code** extensively
4. **Join communities** and ask questions

### For Intermediate Developers:
1. **Learn system design** principles
2. **Contribute to open source** projects
3. **Mentor junior developers**
4. **Understand business requirements**

### For Everyone:
- **Never stop learning**—technology evolves rapidly
- **Build relationships**—your network is your net worth
- **Document your journey**—it helps others and yourself
- **Take calculated risks**—growth happens outside comfort zones

## What's Next?

My journey continues as I work on **laboratory automation systems** that enable scientific discoveries. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities to make a meaningful impact.

The path from intern to full-stack engineer isn't linear. It's filled with learning opportunities, setbacks, victories, and continuous growth. Embrace the journey—every step teaches you something valuable.

**Remember**: Your next opportunity might come from an unexpected place. Stay open, stay curious, and keep building.
