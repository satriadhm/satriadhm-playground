**Disclaimer:** These are my personal takeaways and stories, so they may apply or not apply to your situation.

I was not a tech enthusiast; I spent my high school doing something people would say was cool during my age (music, sports, and skipping school). But then, at least once in a lifetime, we should take a big leap of faithâ€”a big decision based on uncertainty. One big decision was jumping into the world of Software Engineering (not really computer science, since I got a partial scholarship in the Software Engineering Program).

These are my milestones, sorted by my college semesters and the lessons learned along the way.

## The Struggling Beginning (1st - 2nd Semester)

I was so depressed that I didn't understand anything about programming and software development. I survived these years by always asking for help (thanks to my faithful friends). Luckily, I got into Software Design, particularly UI/UX Design. I made some portfolios and had some role models that I followed.

During these years, I really didn't understand that **consistency is the main part of mastering something**, so I learned Software Project Management as well, praying that I could master the field. In that year, I couldn't see myself as a Software Engineer, or maybe not yet.

## The First Stroke of Luck (3rd Semester)

This was the year I got accepted as a Practicum Assistant in Algorithm and Programming, something that I didn't really understand. This was the first stroke of luck in my college, and later would be followed by another stroke of luck in the near future.

By this time, I still couldn't see myself mastering programming and software development, since I had to earn some money just to survive and didn't really have time to learn. Also, I would still call myself dumb because it was hard for me to understand the Data Structure topic, something that we, as sophomores in the Software Engineering Program, needed to understand.

### Mistake #1: Inconsistency in Fundamentals

This was the first mistake that I couldn't avoid, and I hope that anybody who reads this will eventually avoid it in the future: **we need to be consistent in studying the fundamentals**. I was so money-oriented that I was a hard worker in several different jobs at that time, looking down on my conditions, but at the same time, I always found excuses not to study the fundamentals and always looked for the easiest ways.

## The Enlightenment (4th Semester)

This was the year I really found my goal in Software Engineering: **"to never-endingly construct and build software."**

There are 2 courses that have been sticking in my mind until this day: Software Construction and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I found the intuition of building products by reading the Object-Oriented Programming course. Finally, I was proud of myself for understanding the OOP concepts, and later I still used them in my interviews and got accepted by some companies.

This year was the first year I found the true meaning in learning software engineering. It was my first time joining and winning a competition that made me find it. Unfortunately, my role at that time was not a hacker (dev), since I found myself not capable enough to truly build a Flutter-based mobile app. But this was the time I understood **the feeling of building a product from scratch**. It was so satisfying and fulfilling.

### The Overload Experience

This was the time I created 2 final projects for my 2 favorite courses of all time (Software Construction and OOP). I really built something from scratch (a desktop-based app built on C# .NET and Java Maven), learned version controlling, implemented the Software Design principles, and led the Software Engineering phases.

In the middle of this semester, I also got accepted in my first internship (without a recruitment test phase) as a Software Engineer intern at KamarPelajar. I was really thankful to Pak Satu Cahaya Langit (a very cool name indeed), KamarPelajar CEO, for always being there for me during my web dev learning in KamarPelajar (using Laravel PHP).

So, can you imagine I was learning 3 different programming languages at a time?

### Mistake #2: Learning Too Many Things Simultaneously

This eventually led to my second mistake: **not learning just one particular thing (programming language) at a time**. Again, I was so money-oriented that I thought I would get some money from my internship, but I missed the biggest part, which was learning.

### Mistake #3: Having Too Many Things in Mind

The 4th semester was my 2nd craziest semester because I took too many programs, and half of them were just to make me some money. I was a Lecture Assistant in 3 different courses, a Practicum Assistant, an Internship member at KamarPelajar, learning 2 software dev based courses, teaching courses in my faculty, etc.

**Things would be different if I just focused on one thing and became a master in it, then moved on to another.** I found myself drowning in an overworked and overwhelmed daily life, and it was hard to get up and truly learn a thing.

## Global Internship Program: Illumination

I still cannot believe that I am living a fast-paced life. One year I called myself dumb and didn't really understand a single principle in Data Structure, but another year I went to Vietnam as a Software Engineer intern in one of the biggest DX (Digital Transformation) industries in Southeast Asia.

One of the main things that helped me to get accepted was the role I held as a Practicum and Lecture Assistant, even though I didn't really understand programming. I used to memorize the trade-offs between Searching and Sorting algorithms, and that was the particular question asked of me in the interview.

I wondered if I hadn't asked my Professor to let me re-learn the material as a Lecture Assistant, things would have been different. Life was great in Vietnam, and I could say that it was my first flight and live-abroad experience ever. It opened a lot more opportunities, and I did live a great life there, something I couldn't get in my country.

## The Dark Cloud After Illumination (5th Semester)

Being star-syndromed after the Global Internship Program and getting accepted into one startup company as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer through finishing a boot camp made me forget my true goal in college.

### Mistake #4: Stopping the Practice

I stopped programming, building products, joining competitions, and just focused on earning money. This led to my 4th mistake: **stopping doing it**. Well, most of my mistakes were related to financial problems. Yes, that is true, because I really needed the money, so I couldn't avoid it. (I hope you can avoid it).

I made some other mistakes this semester. For example, I used my credit pass in the Web Development course because I believed myself capable of passing the course through the internship. But I was not. I had missed a lot of fundamentals in website development, something I truly regret until this day.

Secondly, I thought I would switch my career to Software Tester because of my latest internship experience. This was so wrong, since last semester I had just started my pathway to mastering Software Dev. This is a representation of **inconsistency between my semesters**.

## Getting Back to the Road (6th Semester)

I can say this semester was my wildest semester. I won 2 out of 4 competitions, got 2 fundings for projects from the Ministry of Education in Indonesia, and also got accepted to go to Granada, Spain, for student exchange.

But I was still a money-oriented guy, so I still did my job to earn money and hustle myself up. The days seemed like they would last forever in this semester because this was the peak of my mistakes. I was, in many ways, **overworked and over-productive**.

This was the hardcore semester, since I really coded my ass off. You know, the previous mistakes started to have impacts. I missed a lot of fundamentals, and I still didn't understand a lot of concepts in software engineering, yet I did a massive number of projects.

This turned me crazy since I had to use Gen AI for some of the work and needed to debug the bugs later. **The feeling of incapability haunted me day and night.** I almost gave up during this semester. Luckily, I won 2 competitions, so the feeling eventually turned to be balanced.

But I did learn a massive load of new understandings and concepts during this semester, but at the same time, imposter syndrome haunted me. But I believe I walked the right path, the same path I had walked in the previous year (4th semester). I wondered if I had mastered the fundamentals, I think I would have been able to do it all seamlessly.

## IISMA: The Escape to Granada

Did I mention Granada before? Yes! After a total of 6 semesters of overworking, I eventually went to Spain. For the first time in my college life, **I truly enjoyed living my life**. There was no more fast-paced learning and demanding the understanding of new tech.

This semester was also the first semester I got a contract job from one of the biggest banks in Indonesia from a friend's referral. This was the first time I knew that **it is who we are working with and working for that could lead us to bigger opportunities**.

### Final Mistake: Lack of Focus

But essentially, I made my last mistake in terms of inconsistency: I took International Marketing and International Management. Could you believe it? I really tried to learn all things, but not truly tried to master them.

This was the semester I got to make a decision about my final thesis topic. Yeah, I did my final thesis proposal abroad, something I couldn't imagine before. But this time, I finally lived my life to the fullest, met great people, tried new different things outside college life, and so on. So, even though I took a wrong (not so wrong) course, I would never regret the decision to go abroad.

## The Payback (8th Semester)

This is my last semester in college. This is the time all my mistakes start to haunt me. I failed to get a full time position in a Japanese start up company because of the incapability I had during the interview. I got rejected by several companies because I didn't have enough portfolios and haven't documented it on any platforms. One company betrayed me, and I got to continue my thesis during the Tech Winter times in Indonesia.

The beginning of this semester was so sick and awful. But there was a time that I tried to apply to a US-based company in my hometown, [Formulatrix](https://formulatrix.com/). The recruitment process was tough. But the test focused heavily on OOP and .NET programming, topics I used to find enjoyable back in my fourth semester.

**So the fundamentals have helped me, again, with the recruitment process.**

Later I continued to finish my thesis and published it at an International Conference. Then I just need to finish my studies and graduate.

## Key Takeaways

I can say that I got advantages by actually learning the topic, **from the fundamentals**. So for me, **career is as far as the fundamentals**.

Now I need to step back as I will graduate soon and continue working at [Formulatrix](https://formulatrix.com/), to just re-learn computer science (not really Software Engineering because I need the fundamentals). I believe **a few steps back leads to a higher jump in the future**, so let's see what can I get after this, and I hope you can learn from my mistakes.

### The Five Critical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Inconsistency in studying fundamentals** - Always prioritize understanding the basics before moving to advanced topics
2. **Learning too many things simultaneously** - Focus on mastering one programming language at a time
3. **Having too many commitments** - Quality over quantity; focus on fewer things and excel at them
4. **Stopping practice** - Never stop coding, building, and practicing, even when busy with other commitments
5. **Lack of focus and consistency** - Stick to your chosen path and avoid constantly switching directions

### Final Thoughts

The journey through software engineering has been filled with ups and downs, mistakes and victories. The most important lesson I've learned is that **fundamentals matter more than anything else**. No matter how many shortcuts you try to take or how many different paths you explore, you'll always come back to the basics.

If you're starting your journey in software engineering, remember: consistency beats intensity, focus beats variety, and fundamentals beat everything else.

Cheers!
